Welcome to Bone Your Buddy, the Card Game All About Losers, Not Winners.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a text based version of a card game my family loves to play called Bone Your Buddy. 

The goal is simple: Do not hold the lowest card.

* One card is dealt to each player and the player left of the dealer starts the round.
* Players take turns announcing if they are keeping their card or if they want to trade their card for the card on their left.
  * Remember, the goal is to not have the LOWEST card, so play your odds right.
  * Once you choose to trade that is your card for the rest of the round.
* If the player on your right wants to trade you must give up your card UNLESS you hold a King.
  * Kings are "stopper" cards and can't be traded. They are also the highest ranked card.
* The last player can either keep their card or, since there are no other players to trade with, trade with the top of the deck.
  * Preferably, they will lay their card face up so everyone can see and watch in suspense as the card on the top of the deck is flipped over.
    * Will they have upgraded?? Or will they have downgraded??
* After everyone has gone, all cards are flipped over and the player (or players in cases of pairs) with the lowest card(s) is identified.
* Loser(s) put(s) a quarter in the pot.
* Cards are put in discard pile.
* First player becomes dealer.
* Dealer deals cards out from remaining deck.
  * If the remaining deck is too small to support N + 1 players, discard pile is added and the deck is reshuffled.

# Notes:
There is a slight advantage to going last. This is why the starting player of the previous round now deals and the next player starts the new round.

Keep in mind, the goal is to simply not have the lowest card. 
If you have a 2 and the player to your right trades you and gives you their 3, well you know for a fact now that someone has a lower card than you.
This is the perfect time to exclaim "I"M GOOD" with the biggest smile you have knowing the person who traded you just screwed themselves.




* Card values are: 
    * Aces   = 0
    * 2 - 10 = Face value
    * Jack   = 11
    * Queen  = 12
    * King   = 13/Stopper
